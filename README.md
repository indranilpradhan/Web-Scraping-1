Indra is cricket fan and does not want to miss even a single delivery of a match. But fortunately or
unfortunately, Indra is in IIIT and has very little time to keep track of the score. Help him to
somewhat enjoy the cricket match by writing a cool python script.
Collect Ravi Shashtri’s/Danny Morrison’s/or any other’s commentary samples from internet (this
can be done manually). Now write a python script that continously monitors the cricket score from
a suitable website and plays respective audio file.
Example: Whenever a six is hit, you can play the audio like https://youtu.be/sAevuDJFgZ4?t=12
(listen from 0:14 to 0:20).
Example: Whenever a wicket falls, you can play the audio like https://youtu.be/aUjHgvtyYE4?
t=106
You can keep more than 1 sample for each type and play a random one everytime.
Cases to consider : Boundary (4s), Sixes, Wicket
